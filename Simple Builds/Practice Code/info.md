My Projects Notes:

#### This is my first time doing python, ive compiled this file in order to share my experiences of python
#### Python has allowed me to learn many skills such as early stage game development with Turtle and many user|multi-player simple games, webscraping with Beautiful soup, Pandas and matplotlibs, working with numbers using numpy
#### Using these skills I have been able to work on data analysis projects 
#### My next goal is to learn desktop GUI systems and machine learning AI projects paired with data analysis skills
